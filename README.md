# Monster-Database
D&amp;D 5th Edition Monster Database in MySQL with Web Interface

When the 5th edition monster manual came out there were no tables of creatures by challenge rating or attributes or anything like that. It turns out they were in the next book, the dungeon master's guide which was released two months later. This lack of tables prompted me to put together this project for my Databases class final at OSU. The web interface allows users to add, edit, sort and view the creatures from the manual and create their own.
